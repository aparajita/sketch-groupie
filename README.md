# Groupie
Sketch provides a way to align layers to the artboard and to each other, but for some reason it does not provide a way to center or align layers with their parent group. Groupie fills in that gap.

## Install with Sketch Runner

With Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` command and search for `Groupie`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).

## Manual Installation
1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/aparajita/sketch-groupie/releases/latest) and download `Groupie.sketchplugin.zip`.
1. In Sketch, go to `Plugins > Manage Plugins...`, click on the gear icon, and select `Show Plugins Folder`.
1. Un-zip the downloaded zip archive and then double-click the `Groupie.sketchplugin` file to install it.

## Usage

Select one or more groupable layers and then select an item from the `Plugins > Groupie` menu. All of the selected layers will be centered or aligned to their parent group in the chosen manner. This works even when selected layers are members of different groups.

**Note:** If a layer is not within a group, it is centered or aligned to its artboard.

### Key equivalents
